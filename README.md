## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and Vercel for continuous deployment.

### GitHub Actions

Two workflow files are provided:

1. **CI Only** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Runs tests and type checking but doesn't handle deployment.
   Use this if you're using Vercel's GitHub integration for automatic deployments.

2. **Full CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`): Handles both testing and deployment to Vercel.

### Setting Up Vercel Deployment

#### Option 1: Vercel GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel through their dashboard
2. Use the CI-only workflow file (no additional setup required)

#### Option 2: GitHub Actions Deployment

If using the full CI/CD workflow, add these repository secrets:

-   `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel API token (from Vercel account settings)
-   `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID
-   `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

To find your Vercel project and org IDs, run:

```bash
npx vercel login
npx vercel link
```

### Workflow Status

You can view the status of all workflows in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

## üìä How It Works

The retirement calculator uses compound interest principles to project how your savings will grow over time. It takes into account:

-   Your current age and target retirement age
-   Initial savings amount
-   Monthly contribution amount
-   Expected annual rate of return on investments
-   Expected annual inflation rate

The calculator generates:

1. A projected growth chart showing the breakdown of initial savings growth, contribution growth, and total savings
2. An estimate of total retirement savings
3. The inflation-adjusted value (in today's money)

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests

The application includes comprehensive unit tests for all financial calculations and components:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests

We use Cypress for E2E testing to ensure the application works correctly from a user's perspective:

```bash
# Open Cypress UI for interactive testing
npm run cypress

# Run all E2E tests headlessly
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with a development server
npm run test:e2e:dev
```
